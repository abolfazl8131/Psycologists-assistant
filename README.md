# About the project

## Hello Mates! I'm happy to share my MLops Knowledge on designing a continuous learning (LLM) pipeline. 


![mlops](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75cd44dc-c004-4909-9340-6eab96647e45)

Here is a high-level design of my project
you can execute scripts and see what happens.

[!TIP]
The pipeline is made using the MLFlow stack, even for model tracking or deployment.
[!NOTE]
Because of the lack of cloud resources in the Islamic Republic of Iran, I skipped the model deployment on the cloud and just did deployment on my local for the test.
[!WARNING] 
Local deployment with model serve is not a valid deployment scenario for production! just use it in the test stage.
